# AI-Based Mental Health Assessment and Awareness Tool for Rural Communities

This project was developed as part of a final year research initiative focused on promoting mental health awareness in rural areas using machine learning. Our team conducted field visits to collect real-world mental health survey data, and I was responsible for building the machine learning backend.

##  Contribution

I handled the ML pipeline, including:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualizations
- Data preprocessing and feature selection
- Model training and evaluation using:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Accuracy comparison across models

##  Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn  
- scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook

##  Dataset

- Collected manually from rural areas via survey
- Included demographic and psychological assessment questions
- Data was cleaned, analyzed, and split for model training/testing


##  Model Insights

Each model was trained on 80% of the data and evaluated on 20% test data. Key metrics used include accuracy score and visual analysis of feature impact (age, gender, etc.) on outcomes.

##  Deployment Status

While an AI chatbot frontend was planned for integration, it could not be deployed due to restrictions in Gemini API access. However, the backend ML system is fully functional and tested.

## ðŸ“Œ Highlights

- Focus on mental health literacy in underserved regions
- Use of ethical AI practices for community-level support
- Collaborated with PhD researchers for validation and guidance
